# TODO
(In no particular order)

- Type Inference (pass "guess" of type into the typechecking methods)
- Implement boolean and/or (&& / ||) operators
- Field-wise type declaration (see Person type in test.meg)
- Union type declaration (see PrimitiveTypes.NUMBER, which is a precursor to this)
- Add line/col numbers to Tokens / Error messages
